# Basic Expressions and Operations

# Exponent
exp = 4 ** 2        # Evaluates to 16

# Modulus/remainder
modulus = 11 % 2    # Evaluates to 1

# Integer division/floored quotient
int_div = 32 // 8   # Evaluates to 4 

# Division
div = 32 / 8        # Evaluates to 4.0

# Multiplication
mult = 2 * 5        # Evaluates to 10

# Subtraction
subtract = 44 - 20  # Evalueates to 24

# Addition
addition = 3 + 4    # Evaluates to 7
